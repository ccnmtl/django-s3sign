0.5.0
==================
* Refactored upload logic out of view code
* Added .avif image format.

0.4.1 (2025-01-10)
==================
* Recognize heic and heif MIME types.

0.4.0 (2023-09-21)
==================
* Adjust S3Upload.file_dom_selector to allow for any DOM selector
  rather than just an ID.
* Introduced new optional param `file_dom_el` for passing in the file
  input element directly. This is convenient when initializing
  S3Upload from an event, as you can just pass in the event.target
  object.

0.3.3 (2023-03-03)
==================
* Fixed bug where `acl` attribute was not working, preventing the
  ability to upload objects with `public-read` access.

0.3.2 (2022-04-01)
==================
* Don't call onProgress event handler if file list is empty.

0.3.1 (2022-02-17)
==================
* Use default max file size of 2gb.
* Update default expiration time to 8 hours.
* Introduce configurable region name, via
  `AWS_S3_REGION_NAME`. Defaults to us-east-1.

0.3.0 (2021-09-15)
==================
* Use presigned POST request instead of PUT.
* Add a configurable policy limit (default 4mb) for uploads.

0.2.1 (2021-09-10)
==================
* Move s3 signing functions out of the view so they can be imported
  and used separately.
* Add bmp image support.

0.2.0 (2021-09-08)
==================
* This library now requires boto3 and botocore to be installed.
* The `amz_headers` view option has been replaced by the `acl`
  option. This is 'public-read' by default. Set it to None or
  'private' for non-public assets.
* Use boto3 for signing the PUT request.
* Use AWS Signature version 4 for signing URLs. This avoids the needs
  for quoting which has led to encoding bugs.
* Add a ContentType fix on PUT request that fixes a bug where SVG's
  can't be uploaded.

0.1.9 (2021-09-08)
==================
* Fix bug where signatures with '+' in weren't being properly encoded.

0.1.8 (2021-09-02)
==================
* Add `SignS3View.private` flag to determine whether we're uploading
  private resources. If so, return the signed GET url so the media can
  be displayed immediately on upload.

0.1.7 (2021-09-02)
==================
* Don't use amz headers for signature calculation if they aren't
  present.

0.1.6 (2021-09-01)
==================
* Add webp, svg, and pdf mime types.
* Allow amz acl to be configurable in S3Upload.js

0.1.5 (2021-03-08)
==================
* Update base64.encodestring() to encodebytes().

0.1.4 (2017-10-12)
==================

* Added unicode support / python3 compatibility
